# Website

Hello! Welcome to the repo of my first public website.

My intention is to sharpen my front-end development skills by creating a website that tells a bit about myself and shows anyone that happens upon it I've got some idea of how web-development works.

I'll be continually updating the site as I learn more. Please take a peak around and don't be afraid to offer suggestions on how I might improve things!

## Getting Started

I'm working in a webpack environment. To get the dev environment up and running, be sure you've got Node installed then run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start both your node server and the webpack dev server.
